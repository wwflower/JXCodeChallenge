# Code Challenge Two

The purpose of this code test is demonstrate your ability to debug and enhance
existing code as part of a team.
There are two parts to the challenge so please
check in the completed Part 1 prior to do working on Part 2.

Feel free to ask questions or for help.

## Part One: Debugging

### Requirements:
- The program must read a text file and sort the results.
- The user must be able to provide the name of the file to read in the current directory
- The user must be able to specify which columns to sort on using 1 to indicate the first, 2 to indicate the second and so on.
- The order of the sorting is determined by the order in which the columns are listed.
- The program should print the sorted results

### Assumptions:
- The input file is expected to have comma delimited values which may all be treated as string.
- Every row should have the same number of entries.

This program reads a file, accepts a sorting option, and prints the results.
If you call it without options, it will provide usage instructions.

You have been provided with 3 test files. It is recommended that you get TestOne
working first, then TestTwo and finally TestThree.

Make comments in the code about what you fixed and how you fixed it.
Submit a pull request and make sure it gets accepted or address any issues.

## Part Two: Enhancement

Add a parameter to treat first row as a heading row, excluding it from the sort.

As before, make comments in the code about your solution.
Submit a pull request when you have it working.

## Follow up

When you're finished, let's meet. You will be asked to explain your debugging process
and options that you considered for enhancement.
